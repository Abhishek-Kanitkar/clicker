# 1.0.0 (2016-04-20)

### Features

* **[#68](https://github.com/lathonez/clicker/issues/68)** Lightweightify ([commitHash](https://github.com/lathonez/clicker/commit/commitHash))

### BREAKING CHANGES

Lightweightify is a major refactor to the framework. See the issue for why this has been done.

The main changes are listed below:

* unit tests are now bundled into `test.bundle.js`
* sourcemaps are now produced @ `test.bundle.js.map`
* coverage is remapped onto source Typescript meaning that transpiled javascript is no longer pushed to `./coverage/source`
* gulpfile.ts has had a [large refactor](https://github.com/lathonez/clicker/commit/3119b92) away from the ng2-seed style and back toward what everyone else seems to be doing
* the following files have been removed as they are no longer required
..* .travis/push_built_tests.sh
..* coverage/source/**.js
..* test/ionic-angular.js
..* test/test-main.js
* `app.stub.ts` has been renamed and largely re-written in `app.stub.js`, as was required by a change in the process

Migration

I strongly suggest adopting the new framework as it brings with it many benefits. I will update this if firsthand information is forthcoming:

* nuke the `./test` and replace it with the new version. Note that any proxies for external modules in `karma.conig.js` are no longer required, thus there should be no project specifics in that folder
* remove the `export function main()` wrapper from your `*.spec`: [example](https://github.com/lathonez/clicker/commit/f1b72ee)
* merge `package.json` (just for dependencies), some have been removed, some added. Note dependencies are now documented in README.md

Hopefully that should be it.
